  Hi, my name's Jason Chen and I'm pursing the joint M.S. degree with the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the  Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of Prof. Hu Han in 2021 and Prof. Xiao Jun in 2022.
  I also collaborated with Prof. Shiguang Shan closely.

  My research interests include <mark>3D computer vision</mark> and <mark>video algorithm</mark>.

  Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from the Department of Information Security, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU).

          - Approached the problem of natural <mark>face self-occlusion</mark> recovery using a new generative adversarial network.
          - Designed a multi-view Residual-based GAN Inversion to re-render and refine multi-view 2D images.
          - Designed a <mark>differentiable screened Poisson blending</mark> equation solving method.
          - Performed <mask>unsupervised training</mask> using <mask>unpaired data</mask>.
          - Got <mask>accepted</mask> by AAAI 2022 (with 4 accepts among 6 review comments).

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
